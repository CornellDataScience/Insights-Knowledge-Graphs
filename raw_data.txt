Families from China were among those who allegedly paid the most in the college admissions scandal, a new sign of the reach of the cheating ring.
One Chinese family allegedly paid $6.5 million to William “Rick” Singer, the California-based college counselor who has admitted to masterminding the scheme, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Another was the family of a student referred to in court filings as “Yale Applicant 1”—who paid $1.2 million to secure her admission to Yale University. Ms. Guo had her eye on Columbia University or Oxford University. The student is 21-year-old Sherry Guo, who moved to Southern California from China to attend high school, her lawyer confirmed. Ms. Guo learned English after arriving in California about five years ago, Mr. Spertus said. She attended Serra Catholic High School in San Juan Capistrano, Calif., south of Los Angeles, starting high school as an older student. A growing number of Chinese families are bringing their children to the U.S. for high school, or even elementary school, in the hopes of helping smooth the path to college admission down the line. Colleges sometimes scrutinize foreign agents who help coordinate applications from overseas students, but less so the role of U.S. based independent college counselors—particularly those whose main client base is domestic.
